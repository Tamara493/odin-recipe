            <h2>Indgredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup long-grain rice</li>
                <li>1/4 cup finely chopped parsley</li>
                <li>1/4 cup finely chopped mint</li>
                <li>1/4 cup finely chopped dill</li>
                <li>1/2 pound ground meat (optional) </li>
                <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
                <li> 1 jar (16 ounces) grape leaves</li>
                <li>2 cups tomato sauce</li>
                <li>1/4 cup lemon juice</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Steps</h2>
              <ol>
             <li>If using fresh grape leaves, blanch them in boiling water for 1-2 minutes to soften them. If using jarred grape
              leaves, rinse them under cold water to remove any brine.</li>
              <li>In a pan, heat some olive oil over medium heat. Add the rice and any desired herbs and spices, 
                such as parsley and mint, to the pan and saut√© for 1-2 minutes.</li>
                <li>If using ground meat, add it to the pan and cook until it is browned.</li>
                <li>Remove the pan from the heat and let the filling mixture cool slightly.</li>
                <li>Lay a grape leaf, vein side up, on a flat surface. Place a spoonful of the filling mixture near the stem end of the leaf. Fold the stem end over the filling, then fold in the sides and roll the leaf tightly to enclose the filling. 
                  Repeat with the remaining grape leaves and filling.</li>
                  <li>In a large pot, arrange the stuffed grape leaves in a single layer, seam side down.</li>
                  <li>In a separate pan, heat some olive oil over medium heat. Add a can of crushed tomatoes and lemon juice to
                     the pan and bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
                     <li>Pour the tomato sauce over the stuffed grape leaves in the pot. 
                      The sauce should come about halfway up the grape leaves.</li>
                      <li>Place a plate on top of the grape leaves to keep them in place. Cover the pot and cook over medium heat for 
                        45-60 minutes, or until the grape leaves are tender.</li>
                        <li>Serve the warak enab warm, garnished with additional herbs if desired.</li>
              </ol>
