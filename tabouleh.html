        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Tabouleh</strong> is a refreshing and flavorful <em>Lebanese</em> salad made with bulgur, 
            finely chopped parsley, mint, tomato, and onion. It is typically 
            seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice, and spices such as garlic 
            and ground cumin. The ingredients are mixed together to create a 
            light and aromatic dish that is perfect for a hot summer day.</p> 
            <p>Tabouleh is often served as a side or appetizer, but it can also 
            be enjoyed on its own as a light meal. It is a popular
             choice for vegetarians and is often served at potlucks 
             and gatherings. Its bright and colorful appearance makes
              it a welcome addition to any table. In addition to being 
              delicious, tabouleh is also a healthy choice as it is high 
              in fiber and nutrients. 
            Try serving it with pita bread or alongside grilled meats for a complete meal.</p>
