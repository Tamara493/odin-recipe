        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Chicken Shawarma</strong> Chicken shawarma is a popular <em>Middle Eastern</em>  dish made by marinating chicken 
            in a mixture of spices, such as cumin, coriander, paprika, a
            nd garlic, and then grilling it on a spit until it is cooked 
            through and slightly charred. The grilled chicken is then 
            thinly sliced and served in a pita bread or wrap with 
            toppings such as lettuce, tomato, onion, and a sauce, 
            such as tahini or yogurt. Shawarma is a delicious and 
            satisfying meal that is enjoyed by people of all ages, 
            and it is often served as a sandwich or platter with sides 
            such as rice, hummus, and salads. Some variations of shawarma also i
            nclude a variety of vegetables, such as grilled onions and peppers, 
            for added flavor and nutrition.</p> 
            <p><strong>Shawarma </strong>is a popular street
                food in many countries in the Middle East, 
                and it is also enjoyed around the world. It 
                is a convenient and tasty meal that can be
                 enjoyed on the go, and it is often served at 
                 food trucks or street stalls. Shawarma is typically 
                 made with chicken, but it can also be made with other 
                 types of meat, such as lamb or beef. The meat is placed on a 
                 spit and slowly rotates in front of a heat source, such as a gas 
                 or charcoal grill, until it is cooked to perfection. As the meat cooks,
                  the outer layers are shaved off and served in a
                pita bread or wrap, along with any desired toppings.</p>
